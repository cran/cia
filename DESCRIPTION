Description: Causal Inference Assistance (CIA) for performing causal inference within the structural causal modelling framework. Structure learning is performed using partition Markov chain Monte Carlo (Kuipers & Moffa, 2017) and several additional functions have been added to help with causal inference. Kuipers and Moffa (2017) <doi:10.1080/01621459.2015.1133426>.
